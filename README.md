Steps on how to create Github page:
    Step 1: Open up the repository containing the webpage you want to create a page on.
    Step 2: Click on the "Settings" option beside the "Insights" option
    Step 3: Under "Code and automation", click on "Pages" option.
    Step 4: Select the branch containing the file, then press save.
    
    Wait for a few minutes, and the link should be found on top of the Pages section.

Key Takeaways:
    HTML-CSS goes hand-in hand in creating webpages, especially if one seeks to create more aesthetically-pleasing webpages since CSS allows the user to be more flexible in designing. The flexbox is also a great help in building a webpage since it helps in arranging the contents and aligning them with one another. Currently, my code can look quite repetitive with all the div and nested groupings, though I think I can still optimize or make it look more clean.
